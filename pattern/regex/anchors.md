In regular expressions, **anchors** are special characters that help define the position of the pattern you’re trying to match relative to the text. They don’t actually match any characters themselves, but they represent positions in the string.

### 1. **Caret `^` and Doller Sign `$`**
- **Definition**: The `^` anchor matches the **beginning of a string**, and the `$` anchor matches the **end of a string**.  
When working in **multiline mode** (which can be enabled in some regex implementations), the `^` anchor will match the beginning of each line, and the `$` anchor will match the end of each line.
- 
  **Example**:
  In multiline mode, the regex:

  ```regex
  ^apple
  ```

  Will match:
  ```
  apple pie
  apple tree
  ```
  
  But **not**:
 
  ```
  I like apple pie
  ```
  
  On the contrary to normal mode, where `^` only matches the start of the string.



### 2. **Word Boundary `\b`**
The `\b` anchor matches a **word boundary**. A word boundary occurs where a word character (`\w` which includes letters, digits, and underscore) is next to a non-word character (`\W`).
Escaped "angle brackets" `\<...\>` mark word boundaries, too. The angle brackets must be escaped, since otherwise they have only their literal character meaning.

`\bcat\b` or `\<bcat\>` will match:
```
cat
The cat sat.
```

But **not**:
```
scatter
cats
```

### 3. **Non-Word Boundary `\B`**
The `\B` anchor matches a **position that is not a word boundary**. In other words, it matches where a word character is adjacent to another word character or a non-word character is adjacent to another non-word character.
```regex
\bcat\B
```

This will match:
```
cats
category
```

But **not**:
```
The cat scatter.
```

### 4. **Start of the String `\A` (Available in Some Implementations)**
- **Definition**: The `\A` anchor matches the **start of the string**, regardless of whether the regex is working in multiline mode.
```regex
\Aapple
```

This will match if `apple` appears at the very start of the string, but it won't work if it appears in the middle or end.

### 5. **End of the String `\Z` (Available in Some Implementations)**
- **Definition**: The `\Z` anchor matches the **end of the string**, similar to `$`, but it ensures the very last position in the string and does **not match a line break** before the end of the string.
- **Usage**: Similar to `$`, but it ensures that it doesn’t match just before a newline character.

```regex
apple\Z
```

This will match:
```
apple
```

But **not**:
```
apple pie
```

Because it ensures that there’s no newline after `apple`.

### Summary of Anchors:
| **Anchor** | **Meaning**                                 | **Example**                                      |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `^`        | Beginning of the string or line             | `^apple` — matches lines starting with `apple`   |
| `$`        | End of the string or line                   | `apple$` — matches lines ending with `apple`     |
| `\b`       | Word boundary                               | `\bcat\b` — matches `cat` as a whole word        |
| `\B`       | Non-word boundary                           | `\Bcat\B` — matches `cat` in `scatter`           |
| `\A`       | Start of the string (not affected by multiline mode) | `\Aapple` — matches `apple` at the very start   |
| `\Z`       | End of the string (not affected by newline)  | `apple\Z` — matches `apple` at the very end     |
| `^` and `$` in multiline mode | Start/end of each line within multiline strings | `^apple` matches `apple` at the start of each line in multiline mode |

### Conclusion:
- **Anchors** in regex allow you to control the position of your matches within a string or line.
- Anchors cause the match to occur only if the regex is found at the position specified by the anchor.
