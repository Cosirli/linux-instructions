## Configuring and using a USB drive on Arch Linux.

---


### **Mounting the USB Drive Manually**
If the USB drive is not automatically mounted, you can mount it manually. 

```bash
lsblk
sudo mkdir /mnt/usb
sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/usb
```

Replace `/dev/sdX1` with the correct partition name (e.g., `/dev/sdb1`). The `1` refers to the partition number, so make sure you choose the correct one for your USB drive.

After mounting, you can access the drive by navigating to `/mnt/usb`.

To unmount the drive when done, use:

```bash
sudo umount /mnt/usb
```
Or:

```bash
sudo umount /dev/sdX1
```

### **Configure Automatic Mounting (Using `udisks2` and `systemd`)**
If you want the USB drive to mount automatically when plugged in, you can use **`udisks2`**, which provides a D-Bus interface for managing disk drives and devices.

Install `udisks2`:

```bash
sudo pacman -S udisks2
```

Once installed, it should automatically handle the mounting of USB drives when plugged in. You can also use the `udisksctl` command to manually mount or unmount devices.

#### Mounting Automatically:
```bash
udisksctl mount -b /dev/sdX1
```

This will mount the USB drive to the default mount point, which is usually `/run/media/username/<drive-label>/`.

#### Unmounting Automatically:
```bash
udisksctl unmount -b /dev/sdX1
```

### 5. **Formatting the USB Drive**
If you need to format the USB drive (e.g., to change the filesystem), you can use `mkfs` (make filesystem). Here’s how to format it as an example filesystem type (e.g., ext4, FAT32, NTFS).

#### Example: Format as `ext4`:

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX1
```

#### Example: Format as `FAT32` (useful for cross-platform compatibility):

```bash
sudo mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdX1
```

#### Example: Format as `NTFS` (for larger files, often used with Windows):

```bash
sudo mkfs.ntfs /dev/sdX1
```

After formatting, you can mount the drive as shown in step 3.

### 6. **Labeling the USB Drive**
You can assign a label to the USB drive, which can help you identify it easily. Here’s how you can do it for different filesystem types.

- **For ext4**:
  
  ```bash
  sudo e2label /dev/sdX1 my_usb_drive
  ```

- **For FAT32**:

  ```bash
  sudo fatlabel /dev/sdX1 my_usb_drive
  ```

- **For NTFS**:

  ```bash
  sudo ntfslabel /dev/sdX1 my_usb_drive
  ```

### 7. **Configuring Persistent Mounting (via `/etc/fstab`)**
If you want the USB drive to be mounted automatically at boot or when plugged in, you can add it to `/etc/fstab`.

#### Find the UUID of the drive:
```bash
sudo blkid
```

This will display the UUID for your USB drive. For example:

```bash
/dev/sdb1: UUID="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="XXXXXXXX-XX"
```

#### Edit `/etc/fstab`:
Open `/etc/fstab` in your favorite text editor:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Add an entry for your USB drive at the end of the file. For example:

```bash
UUID=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX /mnt/usb ext4 defaults 0 2
```

This entry will mount the USB drive at `/mnt/usb` using the ext4 filesystem.

Save and exit the editor. The drive will now be automatically mounted when the system starts or when the device is plugged in.

### 8. **Ejecting or Safely Removing the USB Drive**
To safely remove the USB drive after unmounting, you can use the following command:

```bash
udisksctl power-off -b /dev/sdX
```

This will safely power off the USB device. If you are using a graphical environment, you can also eject the drive from the file manager.

### 9. **Using GUI Tools (Optional)**
If you're using a desktop environment, you can rely on tools like **Nautilus**, **Thunar**, **Dolphin**, or **PCManFM** (depending on your DE) to automatically detect and mount USB drives. These tools typically allow you to eject or safely remove the device with a right-click.

### Summary of Key Commands:
- **Check connected drives**: `lsblk` or `fdisk -l`
- **Mount manually**: `sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/usb`
- **Unmount manually**: `sudo umount /mnt/usb` or `sudo umount /dev/sdX1`
- **Format as ext4**: `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX1`
- **Format as FAT32**: `sudo mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdX1`
- **Label drive**: `sudo e2label /dev/sdX1 my_usb_drive`
- **Automatic mount (udisks2)**: `udisksctl mount -b /dev/sdX1`
- **Auto-mount on boot (fstab)**: Add entry in `/etc/fstab`
